Thanks for taking the Mindapples Test at mindapples.org.

Here are the activities you selected to take care of your mind:

<%- @mindapples.each do |mindapple| -%>
 * <%= mindapple.suggestion %>
<%- end -%>

Your suggestions will be added anonymously to the Mindapples suggestions box, and we'll use your recommendations to help other people find five things that work for them. Your suggestions will also become part of the Mindapples research project to the find a 5-a-day for mental health. So thank you!

We also want to help you do your 5-a-day, so we've made you a personal page at:
<%= @personal_page_url %>

You can edit it any time, and share this link with your friends too.

Thanks for being part of Mindapples. We'll be in touch from time to time with updates to the site and the campaign. In the meantime, follow our progress at http://blog.mindapples.org, get involved at http://mindapples.org/get-involved, and drop us a line any time at hello@mindapples.org

Best wishes,
