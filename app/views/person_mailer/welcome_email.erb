Hello.

Thanks for taking the Mindapples Test at mindapples.org.

Here are the things you said are good for your mind:

<%- @mindapples.each do |mindapple| -%>
<%= mindapple.suggestion %>
<%- end -%>

Your suggestions will be added to the community to help other people find new things that work for them. So thank you!

We've also made you your very own Mindapples page at:
<%= @personal_page_url %>

You can edit it any time via the link above, and share this link with your friends too.

Thanks for being part of Mindapples. We'll be in touch from time to time with updates about the project. You can also follow our progress at http://blog.mindapples.org, get involved at http://mindapples.org/grow, or drop us a line any time at hello@mindapples.org.

Best wishes,
Andy
