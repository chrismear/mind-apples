Thanks for taking the *Mindapples Test* at mindapples.org.

Here are the activities you chose to take care of your mind:

<%- @mindapples.each do |mindapple| -%>
- <%= mindapple.suggestion %>
<%- end -%>

Your suggestions have been added anonymously to the Mindapples suggestions box, and we'll use your suggestions to help other people find 5 things that work for them. Your suggestions will also become part of the Mindapples research project to the find a 5-a-day for mental health. So thank you.

We also want to help you do your 5-a-day, so we've made you a personal page at:
--Person's URL goes here--

You can edit it any time, and share it with your friends, but we won't make it public unless you want us to.

Now, take the *Mindapples Pledge* and promise to do your 5-a-day regularly, and invite your friends to do the same:

Thanks for being part of the Mindapples project. We'll be in touch from time to time with updates to the site and the campaign. In the meantime, follow our progress at http://blog.mindapples.org, get involved at http://mindapples.org/get-involved, and drop us a line any time at hello@mindapples.org
