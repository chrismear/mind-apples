Thanks for taking the Mindapples Test at mindapples.org.

Here are the activities you said are good for your mind:

<%- @mindapples.each do |mindapple| -%>
 * <%= mindapple.suggestion %>
<%- end -%>

Your suggestions will be added anonymously to the Mindapples suggestions box, and we'll use them to help other people find five things that work for them and encourage everyone to come up with their own 5-a-days. So thank you!

We also want to help you do your mindapples, so we've made you a personal page at:
<%= @personal_page_url %>

You can edit it any time, and share this link with your friends too.

Thanks for being part of Mindapples. We'll be in touch from time to time with updates to the site and the movement. In the meantime, why not follow our progress at http://blog.mindapples.org, get involved at http://mindapples.org/grow, or drop us a line any time at hello@mindapples.org.

Best wishes,

Andy Gibson
