Hello.

A while ago you shared the 5-a-day for your mind with us here at Mindapples. What, don't tell me you'd forgotten?

We've made a nice page on the Mindapples website just for you, showing your responses. You can claim your page and read what you said by clicking the link below and following the instructions:
<%= @edit_password_reset_url %>

We hope that you'll make your profile public so that other people can read your mindapples and find new things to do. Our website also lets you read what other people picked, and includes a nice picture of a squirrel.

We hope you like it, and please do tell your friends!

Best wishes,
Andy
