Hello.

Thanks for sharing a 5-a-day for your mind at http://mindapples.org all those many moons ago. Don't tell me you'd forgotten?!

We promised we'd let you know when our new site is ready, so here we are. The new site lets you see your five 'mindapples' online and read what other people picked too. It also features a nice picture of a squirrel.

We've made a page for you on the website. You can claim your page and read your mindapples by clicking the link below and following the instructions:

We hope you like it, and please do tell your friends!

Best wishes,
Andy
