Hello.

Thanks for sharing the 5-a-day for your mind at http://mindapples.org all those many moons ago. What, don't tell me you'd forgotten?

We promised we'd let you know when our new site is ready, so here we are. The new site, launching this week, lets you see your five mindapples online and read what other people have picked too. It also includes a nice picture of a squirrel.

We've made a page for you on the new website. You can claim your page and read your mindapples by clicking the link below and following the instructions:

We hope you like it, and please do tell your friends!

Best wishes,
Andy
