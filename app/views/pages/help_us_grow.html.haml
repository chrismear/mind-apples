  Mindapples is an idea, not a brand. Like the original 5-a-day concept, it needs to belong to everyone if it's really going to work. So, if you'd like to use the Mindapples survey in your work or with your community, please go ahead. Just make sure you credit mindapples.org and tell us what you're doing. We can help too, by giving advice, setting up a
