  Grow your own Mindapples

%p
  Mindapples is just a concept, so we don't own it. Like the original 5-a-day concept, it needs to be owned by everyone or it won't work. If you'd like to use the Mindapples survey with your community, we can help. Get in touch and we can set up a 
  %b
    customised survey 
  for you and sort out the results for you. We’re also very happy to share the results of our survey with other organisations for use in their campaigns and policy work, and promote similar projects that you're running.

  We'd love to hear from you. Drop us a line at
