  If you want to promote mental wellbeing in your organisation or community, or understand what really drives your customers, then you need to know what people enjoy. Mindapples starts conversations about what people say makes them feel good in their heads, and gathers valuable insights into what drives them. We make this information clear and accessible for decision-makers, and advise organisations on how to improve their environment and support person-led activities to promote mental wellbeing at work, rest and play.

  Our "5-a-day for your mind" surveys gather hundreds of fascinating suggestions from individuals about what they need to feel good in their minds. We analyse these suggestions anonymously for clients and compare them to our baseline data, to give our clients valuable insights into the activities and themes that drive their staff, patients, neighbours and customers. Reports are prepared according to client requirements by our experienced insights researchers, and typically include:

    %li highlights from the 5-a-day activities, including the most popular and intriguing ideas

  We can also use our research and engagement skills to investigate particular themes such as workplace stress or community development, and start positive conversations about change. We can extend our basic survey tools to map the specific issues people are facing in their lives and work, and advise clients on the simple things they can change to create significant improvements in the mental wellbeing of their staff, customers and communities. We can also conduct assessments of mental wellbeing and other key metrics, set measurement frameworks for organisations, and investigate particular issues such as workplace stress, redundancy, transition and social isolation.
