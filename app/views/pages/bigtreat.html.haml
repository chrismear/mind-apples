      The Big Treat was part of Courvoisier's two-week Revolutionary Spirit festival, which drew on the collective inspiration of the Courvoisier Future 500 members. Events ranged from themed punch bars located deep within a Punchdrunk Theatre Company and ENO collaboration, to epicurean extravaganza The Complete History of Food, with long term Courvoisier partners Bompas & Parr.
