  How we got here

%p
  The Mindapples journey started out back in March 2008 with an idle question that I put to my friends Dougald and Anna. I was frustrated at how pathologising the mental health debate seemed to be, particularly in the workplace, and also fearful of the potential damage it can do to people's self-esteem and civil liberties. After some seemingly unrelated chats with my friend Paul about social campaigning and the five-a-day campaign in particular, I found myself saying: "I want to know what the mental health equivalent of five-a-day is."  And the idea just stuck. So here we are. But since I'm secretly a historian by nature, I'm going to use this page to keep track of the development of the project so that once we're all rich and famous, you can see how we got here.
