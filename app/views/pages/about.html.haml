  About Mindapples

%p
  Mindapples is a social enterprise that encourages everyone to take better care of their minds through simple daily activities, and is building a popular culture of good habits and self-care for mental wellbeing. We want to make looking after our minds as natural as brushing our teeth, by asking everyone: &#8220;What's the 5-a-day for your mind?&#8221;

%p
  We all know how to take care of our bodies - we can eat healthy food, try to keep fit, brush our teeth and worry about our waistlines. Yet when it comes to our minds, we have no idea what to do, so we take terrible care of ourselves and leave it to the experts to fix us if anything goes wrong. But experts can only do so much. So if we can look after our bodies by going for a run, or eating an apple, then what&#8217;s the equivalent for our minds?

%p
  The original 5-a-day campaign told us to look after our bodies by eating five fruit and veg a day, but our minds are a little bit more complicated. So we don&#8217;t tell people what to do. Instead, we want to know what works for you. We&#8217;re asking everyone to pick their own &#8220;mindapples&#8221; and share them with the world, and using the power of the internet to build a thriving community of people supporting each other to make their minds healthier. And by asking a question which everyone can answer, we hope to open up a new, positive dialogue about mental health which everyone can join in, and make mentally healthy living something aspirational and enjoyable for all.

%p
  This is a community, a campaign, and a business. We offer engagement, research and training services to a wide range of commercial and charitable clients. All our profits are channelled back into the community and to fund a major awareness campaign to promote mentally healthy living and working for everyone, worldwide. We want to reach mainstream audiences to build a shared sense of control and responsibility for our mental wellbeing, and make taking care of our minds a normal, natural thing for all of us. 

%p
  We know there is a market for what we do. So far we have rallied a huge community of fantastic supporters, harvested thousands of mindapples, and built a reputation as a breath of fresh air in the mental wellbeing world. We are currently growing our client base and developing our product range, but we also need donations and funding to scale up our efforts, volunteers to help us grow, and partners from the commercial and public sectors to work with us to build our services and prove the value of our unique approach.
