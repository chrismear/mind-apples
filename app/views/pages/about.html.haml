    “Mindapples is an idea that is gaining ground at a time when both professionals and politicians are focusing on people’s well-being.”

%p
  Mindapples is a social enterprise that helps us all take better care of our minds through simple daily activities. We want to make looking after our minds as natural as brushing our teeth, by asking everyone: &#8220;What's the 5-a-day for your mind?&#8221;

%p
  We all know how to take care of our bodies - we can eat healthy food, try to keep fit, brush our teeth and worry about our waistlines. Yet when it comes to our minds, have very little idea what to do. We take terrible care of ourselves and leave it to the experts to fix us if things go wrong. But experts can only do so much. We need to take better care of ourselves. So, if we can look after our bodies by going for a run, or eating an apple, then what&#8217;s the equivalent for our minds?

%p
  The original 5-a-day campaign told us how to look after our bodies by eating five fruit and veg a day, but our minds are much more complicated. So we don&#8217;t tell people what to do. Instead, we want to know what works for you. We&#8217;re asking everyone to pick their own &#8220;mindapples&#8221; and share them with the world, and using the power of the web to build a thriving community of people supporting each other to make their minds healthier. And by asking a question which everyone can answer, we hope to open up a new, positive dialogue about mental health which everyone can join in, and make mentally healthy living something aspirational and enjoyable for all.

    “a pretty intriguing concept, which could really catch on. Just as gyms became a big thing in the 80s, will the 2010s see the arrival of serious preventative mental health?”

  This is a community, a campaign, and a business. We offer engagement, training and advisory services to a wide range of clients to help encourage and promote mental wellbeing and self-regulation. All our profits are channelled back into the organisation to fund a major awareness campaign to promote mentally healthy living and working for everyone, worldwide. We want to reach mainstream audiences to build a shared sense of control and responsibility for our mental wellbeing, and make taking care of our minds a normal, natural thing for all of us.

  We know there is a market for what we do. So far we have rallied a huge community of fantastic supporters, harvested over 10,000 mindapples, generated considerable
