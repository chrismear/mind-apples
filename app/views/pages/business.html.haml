      Mindapples for Business

    %p
      In the knowledge economy, the performance of your business hinges on the performance of the minds of your staff. Recent studies have shown that staff are 22% less productive when in a negative rather than a positive state (
      %i

      ). Our training programmes introduce valuable knowledge about the human mind into businesses, and our engagement services embed lasting cultural change and help you bring the best out of your people. We aim to go beyond statutory staff healthcare to use wellness as the foundation for peak organisational performance.
