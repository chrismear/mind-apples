  We started Mindapples to help everyone in the UK take better care of their minds, and to do that, we need your help.

  We use the funds we generate from our
  = link_to 'commercial services', services_path
  to run 
  = link_to 'installations and pop-ups', engagement_path
  encouraging people to take better care of their minds, in UK communities, schools, universities and healthcare. We also work with the Government and the NHS to raise the profile of mental health and wellbeing in public health, and pilot services to support at-risk groups and promote mentally healthy living.

  If you like what we do, please make a small donation to our cause. 
  £250 buys a Mindapples Tree for a local school or university, and £50 buys a toolkit for a local organisation to run a Mindapples event. You can give online below, or send cheques payable to 'Mindapples' to us at Mindapples, 145-157 St John Street, London EC1V 4PW.
