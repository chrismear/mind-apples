  Training and workshops

%p
  The human mind is the most sophisticated organ in the world, and we've each been put in charge of one. Yet most of the time it can feel like our minds are in charge of us. Mindapples training helps us understand our minds better and take control of our mental state, by understanding how we work and what we need, so we can make more informed choices to look after our mental wellbeing. We offer this in workplaces to improve staff wellbeing and performance, healthcare to improve patient health, and education to improve life chances.

  Mindapples management training

%p
  We offer intensive 1-2 day training seminars (shorter briefing packages are also available) for corporate leaders and managers looking to lead a positive culture of mental wellbeing at work, and understand how to get the best from their staff.

%p
  All our training services are knowledge-based and offer participants rigorous scientific insights into how their minds work, alongside reflection sessions to explore personal self-management and the impact of mental wellbeing on staff and corporate culture. All our seminars are non-therapeutic and do not require personal disclosure, simply the willingness to engage and learn. This isn't about talking about our feelings, just valuable insights to improve decision-making and support self-management. Delegates also receive a detailed accompanying training pack with references and further reading on mental self-regulation, leadership and influencing techniques and the science of the human mind.

  Mindapples workshops

%p
  We offer short, highly interactive Mindapples workshops, led by experienced facilitators to help groups of up to 30 people reflect on their needs and understand how to take better care of their minds. 
  
%p
  Participants explore their individual and collective needs together, and are introduced to the basic principles of mental self-regulation. They take away their 5-a-day suggestions as highly designed keepsakes to remind them of their mindapple activities and help them to build good habits. Participants are then invited to engage in further exploration of the activities that work for them, and to see what others have said, via the online community tools on the Mindapples website.

  The aims of these workshops are to engage participants in considering the health of their minds, start positive conversations about mental wellbeing, make them more conscious of how their actions influence their mental and emotional state, and make it easier for individuals to understand and articulate their needs. By the end of the workshop, participants will:
  %ul
    %li feel more confident about their ability to cope and look after themselves;
    %li understand more about what works for them and how to monitor and maintain their mental wellbeing;
    %li know how to have more positive and constructive conversations with third parties about issues;
    %li connect with others around mutual support and positive reinforcement around healthy activities; and
    %li feel heard and valued as individuals and more in control of their mental wellbeing.

%p
  We are also developing digital tools and training services to help individuals manage their minds and make more informed choices about their mental health, and we are now seeking partners to help us develop and trial these services.
