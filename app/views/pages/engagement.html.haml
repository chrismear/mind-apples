  Engagement services 

%p
  What are you doing to engage people in mental wellbeing? Mindapples engages staff, patients and citizens in wellbeing and turns them into active participants in a positive conversation about how to be healthier and happier.

%p
  All our engagement services begin with the core Mindapples question 'what's the 5-a-day for your mind?' This deceptively simple question offers a new, positive route into the topic for employers, policymakers, healthcare providers, charities, brands and the media. The question itself also contains vital knowledge for individuals about the importance of looking after our minds and the role of good habits and self-care in maintaining mental wellbeing. Our engagement tools have been tested everywhere from the Secret Garden Party to Brixton Village and the BBC, and we're always looking for new places to try our unique engagement approach.

  Digital engagement

%p
  We use digital tools to engage people at scale for low costs and get large numbers of individuals sharing their mindapples and joining the conversation. We invite public contributions to the Mindapples survey through our website www.mindapples.org, and run bespoke surveys and online communities for clients to help large groups of people discuss what works for them and find new activities to try. We are also developing digital support tools to help individuals monitor their wellbeing and develop good habits to maintain their mental health.

  Installations and events

%p
  We support and promote our scalable digital tools through more traditional methods of engagement, using eye-catching installations to start positive conversations and gather 5-a-day suggestions from all kinds of people, in private and at public events.

  The Mindapples Tree is a unique installation which engages passers-by in sharing their mindapples on specially-designed cards and hanging them on the tree, creating a fascinating display of all the things people are doing to look after their minds. In 2010 the Mindapples Tree was used to engage individuals in a range of contexts including workplaces, cinemas, music festivals, professional conferences and even art galleries. Here is an example of a recent pop-up where we took Mindapples to the streets to talk to engage the public in taking better care of the health of their minds.

  We also bring together great products and services from across the wellbeing world to deliver engaging events, campaigns and pop-ups to promote the activities that our community tells us they want. We've worked with brands like Crussh, Positive Touch, Savvy Cook and Headspace to put together entertaining and rewarding packages to promote wellbeing to the public. We're always looking for imaginative sponsors and clients to create promotional events and start positive conversations about mental and physical wellbeing. Our showpiece event in 2010 was the Big Treat, in partnership with Courvoisier, and here is the video they made of the occasion.

  All our engagement tools have been developed in consultation with our academic and NHS partners and have been rigorously tested in public engagement programmes as diverse as BBC Careerlink, Lambeth GP surgeries, summer music festivals, Edexcel and Brixton Village Market. All the suggestions we collect are also added anonymously to the Mindapples.org community, and can then be analysed by us to deliver valuable insights and recommendations to clients. So, the more we do, the more you learn.
